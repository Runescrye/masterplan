# Masterplan

Masterplan is an application that helps you to build D&D 4E campaigns.

You can outline your plot structure, build encounters and maps, detail your campaign world, and create custom creatures and NPCs.

## Building and running it

Prerequisites - you'll need to have Visual Studio installed (community edition is fine).

To build Masterplan:

* Open `Masterplan.sln` in Visual Studio
* There should be two projects - `Masterplan` and `Utils`
* Build the solution (F6)

Bear in mind that every time you build Masterplan, the library files are copied from `./Libraries` into the output folder, so any changes you make to these libraries won't be retained.
